**AkatroxTempBlocks** A minecraft add-on that allows you to automatically delete blocks placed by players on your Minecraft server after a set time.

<h2>📣 Here are some features 📣</h2>

✅ Check if users who have set specific rank groups and linked their accounts are in that group, and ensure they have the corresponding role on your Discord server. For example: Give the `akatroxdiscordsync.vip` permission to your VIP group (you configure the `.vip` part in the config) and set the corresponding Discord role ID in the configuration. If the user purchases VIP, they will automatically have the VIP role on Discord. Moreover, when this user enters the server, it is checked simultaneously. If the VIP period expires, the role is removed.
